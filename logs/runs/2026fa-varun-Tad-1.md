# 2026FA Run — varun-Tad — Frontend / Full-Stack Sponsorship Triage

## Liveness

## Human gate

Historical sponsorship evidence does not establish current sponsorship. Posting liveness does not establish sponsorship or candidate fit. Final application and verification decisions remain with the job seeker.
